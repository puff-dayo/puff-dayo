# Setsuna

Setsuna is a demi-human girl with blue-ish hair. While most of her body is human-like, she has lupine ears with grey ends and a large tail. She also has a pair of wolf paws.

After having her level cap raised, Setsuna is able to overpower the average human. Her strength cap increases constantly thanks to _some daily actions_. Her attacks could easily incapacitate and even overwhelm multiple opponents at once.

Ice Claws are Setsuna's primary weapon. By enveloping her hands with ice, the result is a pair of sharp claws protruding from her fingers.
